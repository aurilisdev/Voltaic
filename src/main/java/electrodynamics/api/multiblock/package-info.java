 * While many of these functionalities are similar, they fundamentally are not the same. The Subnode system simply gives
 * the impression that a block is multiple blocks in size and places all the subnode blocks at the same time as when
 * the parent block is placed. The Assembly system on the other hand requires you to place a specific pattern of blocks
 * before the multiblock can be formed.
