Wires in this mod function a little differently than what you're used to. For starters, wires do not store energy. Furthermore, if you hover over a wire in your inventory, you will notice it has three fields: Resistance, Ampacity, and Insulation Rating.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l11.1": "%1$s is a measure of how opposed a material is to the flow of electricity, and is measured in units of Ohms, denoted by a capital Omega (Ω). The Resistance of a wire will determine how much energy is lost when a current is developed over it. You can use the formula %2$s to to calculate the exact amount of power lost over a wire. However, the resistance listed for a wire is only for a single wire, and machines tend to be more than one block away from each other. Thus a crucial concept is introduced, in that the longer wires are, the higher their overall resistance. In simpler terms, longer wires have a greater power loss. However, if you analyze the equation, you will observe the resistance is only a linear factor where as the current is squared. Thus power loss over a wire is affected far more by the current flowing over it than the resistance of the wire itself. It is crucial to keep this in mind when designing complex wire layouts, as you might lose a great deal of usable energy to the wires before it even reaches the machine.",

Uninsulated wires can shock you amongst other items that will be covered here shortly.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l12.1": "The topic of insulation is deceptively simple and is worth an in-depth look at this point. Insulation has more factors to consider than just a voltage rating when selecting an insulation type to use. These factors will now be discussed at length.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l12.2": "As discussed, an under or uninsulated wire can shock you. However, this is not the be-all end-all factor for a wire's insulation. You can mitigate the danger of being shocked by wearing %s. You will still take some damage if you are shocked while wearing them, however you will stand a far higher chance of survival. It should be noted this survival chance comes at the price of boot durability, so the best practice is still to not touch an exposed wire in the first place.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l13.1": "Different insulation types also come with pros and cons. Wool-based insulation is cheap, easy to come by, and highly effective:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l13.2": "A specialzed variant of a wool-insulated wire is the Logistical Wire:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l13.3": "It will emit a redstone signal when power is flowing through it.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l13.4": "Ceramic insulation on the other hand is more expensive than wool, but gains the advantage of being fire-proof:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l13.5": "This makes ceramicly insulated wires especially useful when working around fluids like lava. It should be noted though that ceramic insulation is not as effective as woolen insulation, meaning that if you want to insulate high voltages, you will need to take the risk of fire!",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l14.1": "Another property of insulated wires is the ability to be dyed different colors. All insulated wires have a default color that is able to connect to any insulation color and wire type. Black is the default color for woolen insulation and brown is the default color for ceramic insulation. If the color is not the default however, it will only be able to connect to wires colored the default color or wires of the same color:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l14.2": "Being able to color-coat wires has several advantages, the largest of which being the ability to run multiple wires in parallel right next to each other without having them connect. This can be very helpful if you are dealing with machine setups where multiple voltages are involved in tight quarters. ",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l15": "While on the topic of insulation ratings, It is critical to understand that a wire not having sufficiant insulation has greater ramifications than just shocking you. Wires transmitting voltages higher than what they are rated for will have a random chance to set the blocks surrounding them on fire (excluding other wires). If the wire cannot set a flammable block on fire, either by pure chance or becuase you're trying to game the system, then the wire itself will be destroyed. However, this feature can be disabled in the Electrodynamics config file if desired.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l16": "Wires have the ability to be field-modified once placed in the world. If you right-click any insulated wire with Shears (excluding thick wires), it will remove the insulation from the wire. You can also apply woolen and ceramic insulation to an existing wire by right-clicking the insulation on the wire. A woolen wire can be converted to a logistical wire by right-clicking a piece of redstone on it. You can also dye wires by right-clicking the respective dye onto the wire. Note that this is a less-efficiant way to color wires than crafting them to the respective color!",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l17.1": "Now that we know how to get energy to a machine and understand it must be at a specific voltage, you're probably wondering how that voltage is achieved. Most power sources in Electrodynamics are either 120 V or 240 V. This works well for many of the basic machines, but simply won't cut it for more advanced machines that require higher voltages. This is where transformers come in. Transformers function by exchanging voltage for current. This exchange rate can be calculated using what is known as the Turns Ratio, which is given by the formula:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l17.2": "Where N is the Turns Ratio, Np is the number of primary or input turns, and Ns is the number of secondary or output turns. The output voltage can be calculated by dividing the input voltage by the Turns Ratio. The output current can be calculated by multiplying the input current by the Turns Ratio.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l17.3": "Electrodynamics offers two transformer types: Upgrade and Downgrade. The %1$s Transformer steps up voltage, and the %2$s Transformer steps down voltage. The base upgrade variant has a fixed Turns Ratio of 0.5, and the base downgrade variant has a fixed Turns Ratio of 2. While cheap and effective, these base units will shock you when touched if they are live. Electrodynamics also offers improved Mark 2 versions, which while much more expensive, have a programmable turns ratio you can select via the GUI. They are also enclosed and will not shock you when touched. It is important to note that all transformers do have minor loses, so be wise with your use of them.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.1": "Now that we understand the basics of electricity, how it will be interacted with, and how it can be manipulated, we can start to piece the different aspects together. This combination of aspects will be referred to as a %1$s moving forward. Operating machines in a grid introduces more complex scenarios that analyzing individual components in a vacuum may overlook.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.2": "To construct a grid, we must first understand how Electrodynamics' electrical model functions. Electrodynamics assumes that all power sources are agregated into one large power source. It then assumes all loads are in series. This can be modeled with the following circuit diagram:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.3": "This model is not perfect, however it gets the job done, and is about as acurate as you can get without a complex system model using software such as SPICE. Knowing how wire networks are modeled will prove valuable moving forward.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.4": "The first of the more complex concepts that will be introduced is known as Return Current or %1$s. In short, the neutral current means you will lose twice the amount of energy to wire resistance you will think you will lose. While this may sound strange, a detailed examination of how current works will reveal a logical answer. An electrical current requires a return path to its source in order to obey the laws of entropy, that is to say the net electrical charge is zero. In real life, this is accomplished by having a Primary conductor and a Neutral conductor, as can be seen from this image here:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.5": "The Primary Conductor provides the path for the current to the load, and the Neutral Conductor provides the return path for the current to its source. Electrodynamics does not render a Neutral Conductor, however it assumes that Neutral Conductor is the same length as the Primary Conductor, that is to say the wire you place. Thus the total power loss due to resistance can be calculated as %s. As an aisde, in real life there are techniques that can be used to reduce neutral current, however these techniques are beyond the scope of what Electodynamics is capable of.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.6": "Before we proceed to the next complex topic, I would like to address an elephant in the room. You may be wondering: \"How is it possible that the energy returning to the power source is a net of zero if energy is lost on the way to resistance and also used by a power source.\" The first Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed. This applies to electrons as well. If you recall to the first section of this chapter, Voltage was described as the speed of the electricity. The property that will be affected by resistance and load is actually the Voltage. Resistance and load can be thought of as friction slowing the electricity down, the same way a car will eventually come to a stop if you stop accelerating it. This leads to a phenomenon in the real world known as \"Voltage Drop\". Voltage Drop can be a singificant challenge in power delivery, as the load you are serving might have too low of a voltage to run. Fortunately however, Electrodynamics does not simultate Voltage Drop for simplicity's sake.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.7": "The next complex topic that will be covered is known as %1$s. All Electrodynamics machines that use energy have a small internal storage buffer. As they do not have an energy input cap, the empty buffer is seen in its entirety when connected to a live wire. As a result, the current for the device will look akin to the following:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.8": "In short, the current will briefly spike and quickly approach its steady state level as the buffer is charged. Steady State current is the current you would expect the machine to draw. This buffer is provided to help insulate machines against lag, allowing them to keep running if a tick is skipped by the server. The buffer also coincidentally models a real-world phenomenon, in that all electrical devices store energy. You may find this an odd statement. How can energy be stored without a battery? The answer is that energy is stored in Electrical and Magnetic fields. While the amount is insignificant to the amount of energy that can stored by a battery, it still must be accounted for.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l18.9": "Inrush Current will mostly not affect you fortunately. As discussed previously, while wires have a maximum ampacity that cannot be exceeded, they can handle a brief overload for %s ticks before actually failing. 9 times out of 10 this will not be an issue, however it can become a problem if you have a prolonged inrush that exceeds this time limit. This inrush may also falsely trigger protective devices to trip!",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l19.1": "By now, you are feeling overwhelmed most likely. How are you supposed to keep track of what voltage your grid is operating at? How are you supposed to keep track of the overall resistance? Fear not, for Electrodynamics offers several tools and blocks to assist with this, along with other tools you may find useful. These will be covered on the following pages.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l19.circuitbreaker.1": "The Circuit Breaker is an improved version of the Relay.

The %1$s property represents the current wattage of the energy flowing through the wire in real time in units of Watts. The %2$s property represents the current voltage of the energy flowing through the wire in real time in units of Volts. The %3$s property is the maximum current the wire can achieve before it is damaged in units of Amps. The %4$s property is the voltage of the lowest-voltage machine connected to the wire in units of Volts. The %5$s property is the resistance of the wire in units of Ohms. Finally, the %6$s property is the maximum possible energy usage of all machines connected to the wire in units of Watts.

The quantity input into this field is what will be compared against the property selected. It is important to note this value cannot be negative.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.electricity.l19.currentregulator.1": "The Current Regulator is another protective device offered by Electrodynamics. Unlike the Circuit Breaker which is focused on interrupting power, the Current Regulator will ensure that current does not exceed the maximum rated ampacity of the downstream line it is protecting. For example, if the ampacity was 20 A and the current was 30 A, the regulator would ensure the downstream current would not exceed 20 A. Unlike the Circuit Breaker and Relay however, the Current Regulator cannot be opened to interrupt load flow.",

  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l1": "While fluids in Electrodynamics may be similar to what you have seen before in other mods, gases are very much more complex and in depth. However, if you pay attention to a few key items, you will find that working with gases can be fairly painless and easy to do. This chapter will cover the following topics:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l10.1": "The immediate concern now is of course what happens to a gas if it condenses while contained within a machine? On machines that handle gases that also do not have a dedicated output fluid tank, you will notice a greyed out fluid droplet:",

When a gas condenses in one of these machines, the dropplet will light up indicating a gas has condensed into a fluid and has been caught. To extract this caught gas, simply click on the droplet with a bucket or similar item. It is important to note that the runoff catch can only handle one fluid at a time. If a gas condenses while a fluid is held, the existing fluid held by the catch will be lost! The runoff catch is only so large, so be mindful you don't let it get too full either.",

  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l14": "Up until this point, there has been mention of gases at different temperatures and pressures, but no talk of how those values are actually achieved. Sure, some machines might produce a gas at a certain temperature and pressure, but what if another process calls for it to be at twice the temperature and twice the pressure? We now come to what this chapter has been building towards: gas manipulation. Electrodynamics offers dedicated machines for manipulating a gas's pressure and temperature.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l15": "The first category of these machines are the compressors. An important guideline for the Electrodynamics gas system is that recipes will only produce gases at pressures that are powers of 2. The %1$s will take any gas input to it and double the pressure. The %2$s conversely will take any gas input to it and halve the pressure. With this in mind, a parallel can be drawn between the compressors and transformers, in that they function similarly. The base compressors can only process %3$s mB of gas per tick due to their small size. Electrodynamics offers a MK2 variant, that while bigger, is able to process up to %4$s mB of gas per tick.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l16.1": "You may notice however that the input and output tanks on these two blocks have a rather limited storage capacity. This can especially be a problem if you are decompressing a gas. Fortunately, the Compressor and Decompressor can have their storage tank capacities increased by the addition of a %1$s. The Pressurized Tank is placed atop of the input and output tank like so:",

The %1$s is able to heat or cool a gas to any specified temperature. The base model is capable of processing up to %2$s mB of gas per tick. Being as small as it is however, the heating unit on board is only able to transfer %3$s Joules per tick. As with the compressors, a MK2 variant is offered that while bigger is size, is able to process up to %4$s mB of gas per tick, and is able to transfer %5$s Joules of heat per tick. To program the temperature, open the GUI, and input it using the text input bar:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l17.2": "If you paid attention to the condensed gases list from earlier, you may also notice that the %1$s has a fluid input and output tank. If you program the temperature to the gas's condensation point, the Manipulator will in turn condense the gas into a fluid. The manipulator is also capable of converting fluids into gases if the temperature is above the gas's condensation point. Also, like the %2$s and %3$s, the %1$s can have its tank capacity increased with a %4$s.",

  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l18.gascylinder.1": "While pipes may not be able to store gas, Electrodynamics offers bulk gas storage in the form of Cylinders. Gas Cylinders accept gas from the top and output gas through the bottom like a fluid tank. Furthermore, stack two cylinders on top of eachother, and the top one will automatically output into the bottom one. An important thing to note about cylinders however is that they are not thermally adiabatic, and will slowly heat or cool the gas contained within to room temperature. Gas cylinders heat and cool at a rate of %1$s per second. You can help mitigate this by installing a %2$s in the cylinder. Each peice will reduce the rate by %3$s for a maximum of 6 possible reduction of %4$s.",

You will also note there is a \"Whitelist\" and \"Blacklist\" toggle button. In %1$s, the gases in the filter list will be blocked from flowing through the pipe. Having no gases selected means it will allow any gas through like a normal pipe. In %2$s, the gases in the filter will be the only gass allowed to flow through. Having no gases selected means it will allow no gases through.",

  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l18.gaspipepump.2": "The active ability requires the pump to be powered, and has the downside of only working with Electrodynamics gas pipes due to the limitations of the game. When powered and connected to an Electrodynamics pipe network, the pump has the ability to take priority on the transmitted gases. The priority can be programmed in its GUI:",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l18.gaspipepump.3": "The minimum priority is 0 and the maximum is 9. If multiple pumps have the same priority, then the gas will be split evenly among them.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l18.gasvalve.1": "The Gas Valve is a simple bi-directional switch. In the off-position, it will allow gases to flow both ways through it like a standard pipe:",

You can click on the input gas gauge(s) with a portable gas cylinder, and the gas will be extracted from the tank and into the cylinder.

  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l3": "Gases in Electrodyanmics also have a pressure and temperature. We will first cover the mechanics of pressure. %1$s is measured in units of Atmospheres (ATM). The minimum pressure a gas can have is 1 ATM. A gas's pressure however will only be a whole number. In other words, you will never see a gas with a 1.23601 ATM pressure. As a gas's pressure increases, its volume will decrease linearly. For example, if you double the pressure of a gas, its volume will halve.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l4.1": "All items and machines that work with gases have a maximum rated pressure. If this pressure is exceded, then the machine or item may be damaged or even explode! By convention, items with a pressure cap will display the cap when shift is held:",

  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l5": "Another crucial aspect to keep in mind is that gases will seek equilibrium and equalize pressures when two amounts of the same gas at different pressures are mixed. As pressure is always a whole value, the gas with the lowest pressure will become the ruling pressure, and the higher pressure amount will have its pressure lowered in kind.",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.gases.l6": "Now we will cover the mechanics of %1$s. Temperature is measured in units of Kelvin (K), and the minimum temperature a gas can achieve is 1 degree Kelvin. Like pressure, temperature cannot take a non-whole value, meaning a gas cannot have a temperature of 273.163K. As a gas's temperatrure increases, its volume increases linearly. For example, if you double the temperature of a gas, you will also double its volume.",

  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.tips.tip1": "Use Energy Storage frequently. Electrodynamics has several tiers of energy storage. You should invest in using them in all stages of progression. Note, the Capacity Upgrade not only increases the capacity of a Battery Box, but also the output voltage!",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.tips.tip2": "Transmit at High Voltage. This is mentioned in the Electricity chapter, but you should transmit large amounts of power at high voltage and then step it down for distribution. This will help reduce the need for heavy-duty cables as well as the amount of power lost due to the cable's own resistance!",
  "guidebook.voltaic.chapter.tips.tip3": "If you are using an electric tool from Electrodynamics or one of its surrounding mods, there is a good chance that the tool can have its battery replaced. This can be especially useful when you need to recharge a tool and don't have ready access to a charger. A battery can be replaced in one of two ways. The first way is to hold the tool in question in your main hand and press the \"R\" key. A battery with a matching voltage will then be selected from your inventory and placed inside of the tool. The current battery inside the tool will be then placed in your inventory. Note, this method will use the first battery it finds in your inventory, which might mean the battery you want may not be the one that gets used. The second and more precise way to replace a tool's battery is to hover over the tool in question with the battery in your inventory. Then, Right-Click the tool with the battery. If the voltage of the tool matches the voltage of the battery, the new battery will replace the old battery, and you will be left holding the old battery.",
